# How to launch on Windows?
Extract OpenCV 3.0 and make sure you have `build\java\x64\opencv_java300.dll` in a directory specified in your system PATH variable. 
E.g. in the repository root directory. The file has been added to gitignore so it shouldn't appear on GitHub.

Then you can happily launch the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
